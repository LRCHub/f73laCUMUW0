[00:06.46] Call us what we are, toxic from the start
[00:10.14] Can't pretend that I was in the dark
[00:12.21] When you met my friends, didn't even try with them
[00:15.73] I should've known right then
[00:29.73] 
[00:16.86] That you were jealous and possessive
[00:20.05] So manipulatin'
[00:22.85] Honestly, impressive
[00:25.80] You had me participatin'
[00:37.80] 
[00:28.96] Back then, when I was runnin' out of your place
[00:31.91] I said, "I never wanna see your face"
[00:34.69] I meant I couldn't wait to see it again
[00:38.16] We were toxic till the end
[00:40.38] Uh-huh, 'cause even when I said it was over
[00:43.18] You heard, "Baby, can you pull me in closеr?"
[00:45.82] You were plotting how to stay in my head
[00:49.62] Wе were toxic till the end
[01:02.62] 
[00:52.48] Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: The X
[01:14.98] 
[00:57.77] His favourite game is chess, who would ever guess?
[01:01.55] Playing with the pieces in my chest
[01:03.66] Now he's on the screen and saying, "Don't leave"
[01:07.01] You stole that line from me
[01:20.51] 
[01:08.36] 'Cause you're just jealous and possessive
[01:11.38] So manipulatin'
[01:14.16] Honestly, impressive
[01:17.25] You had me participatin'
[01:29.25] 
[01:20.24] Back then, when I was runnin' out of your place
[01:23.25] I said, "I never wanna see your face"
[01:26.11] I meant I couldn't wait to see it again
[01:29.78] We were toxic till the end
[01:31.74] Uh-huh, 'cause even when I said it was over
[01:34.69] You heard, "Baby, can you pull me in closer?"
[01:37.53] You were plotting how to stay in my head
[01:41.08] We were toxic till the end, end, end
[01:59.08] 
[01:48.71] I can forgive you for all of the things
[01:51.16] For not giving me back my Tiffany rings
[01:54.15] I'll never forgive you for one thing, my dear
[01:57.06] You wasted my prettiest years
[02:11.56] 
[02:00.42] Back then, when I was runnin' out of your place
[02:03.25] I said, "I never wanna see your face"
[02:06.04] I meant I couldn't wait to see it again
[02:09.62] We were toxic
[02:11.64] Uh-huh, 'cause even when I said it was over
[02:14.60] You heard, "Baby, can you pull me in closer?"
[02:17.40] You were plotting how to stay in my head
[02:21.01] We were toxic till the end, end, end
[02:26.82] We were toxic till the end, end, end
